urxvt-font-size
===============

This is a perl extension for
[rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) that allows
changing the font size on the fly with keyboard shortcuts. It has the
following features:

-   Supports both xft and X11 fonts; X11 fonts work in both full form and as
    aliases.
-   Supports all four font settings: `font`, `boldFont`, `italicFont` and
    `boldItalicFont` and changes them in accordance with the base font (the
    first one from `font`).
-   Can apply the font change globally for the whole server, so that new
    terminals will inherit the same size, and even save it to `~/.Xresources`
    to be able to survive a reboot.
-   Should work even with complicated font setups like the example in the
    urxvt man-page.

Installation
------------

Put the `font-size` script into `$HOME/.urxvt/ext/` and add it to the list of
enabled perl-extensions in `~/.Xresources`:

```
URxvt.perl-ext-common: ...,font-size
```

Note: if your urxvt version is older than 9.14 you will have to add the path
to the script to the `URxvt.perl-lib` resource.

Add some keybindings:

```
URxvt.keysym.C-Up:     font-size:increase
URxvt.keysym.C-Down:   font-size:decrease
URxvt.keysym.C-S-Up:   font-size:incglobal
URxvt.keysym.C-S-Down: font-size:decglobal
```

The following functions are supported:

-   `increase`/`decrease`: Increase or decrease the font size of the current
    terminal.
-   `incglobal`/`decglobal`: Same as above and also adjust the X server values
    so all newly started terminals will use the same fontsize.
-   `incsave`/`decsave`: Same as incglobal/decglobal and also modify the
    `~/.Xresources` file so the changed font sizes will persist over a restart
    of the X server or a reboot.
-   `reset`: Reset the font size to the value of the resource when starting
    the terminal.

You can also change the step size that the script will use to increase the
font size:

```
URxvt.font-size.step: 4
```

The default step size is 1. This means that with this setting a size change
sequence would be for example 8->12->16->20 instead of 8->9->10->11->12 etc.
Please note that many X11 fonts are only available in specific sizes, though,
and odd sizes are often not available, resulting in an effective step size of
2 instead of 1 in that case.

Troubleshooting
---------------

At its core urxvt-font-size is just a fancy wrapper around the `ESC ] 710;Pt
ST` (and 711/712/713 for bold, italic, and bold-italic) escape sequences. So
if you are having trouble with this script please try the escape sequence
directly like this (outside of a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux):

```
$ echo -e "\033]710;fixed\033\\"
```

You can exchange `fixed` for any (single) font that you want to try, like for
example `-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--12-120-72-72-c-60-iso10646-1`:

```
$ echo -e "\033]710;-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--12-120-72-72-c-60-iso10646-1\033\\"
```

If you can reproduce the problem this way then the problem does not lie with
the urxvt-font-size script, but either directly with urxvt or some other
component that may interfere (like for example a window manager). Please
report the bug to those projects in that case.
